# Landing Page for Mitcdh
This is just a very basic landing page for when someone connects to the domain I use in my personal email address. It is written entirely in HTML/CSS/JS as I wanted it to be static to host on for example Github Pages. There are a few things that I did find kind of fun.

* `background.js`: Will randomly select a picture and assign `background-position` as defined based on what I thought would look best.
* `greeting.js`: Types out a greeting sorted by the viewers languages preferences (then random) obtained from `navigator.languages`.
* `home.css`: Uses Codrops' CSSGlitchEffect to glitch the screen after a time, also includes social icons from fa with particular effort in using a gradient colour for Instagram.
